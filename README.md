# Leech

### Prerequisites

This script is pretty basic for now.

This script requires an existing account on the resin environment that the
device is on. It also requires that the local ssh keys are stored in the resin
account. Just use the same ssh keys you would to push to the
resin account. The resin account needs access to the device to be leeched,
either the device is owned by the account, or the accout is a support agent and
the device is open for support or the account is an admin account.

Make sure you invoked [`resin login`](https://github.com/balena-io/process/blob/master/process/support/accessing_user_accounts_and_devices.md#step-2-connect-to-the-users-device) prior to using this tool.


## Using

```
npm link
```

```
leech diagnose <localDeviceIP|deviceUUID>
```

## usage

```
Use this command to diagnose a local or remote devices

Options:
  -h: hostname, default=ssh.resindevice.io (use ssh.devices.resinstaging.io for staging)
  -u: username used to authenticate ssh keys, default=username retrieved from local resin-token
  -t: track with mixpanel, default=true
Examples:
  $ leech diagnose 0d30096f589da97eb9236abeaee3625a
  $ leech diagnose 192.168.1.125
  $ leech diagnose -h=ssh.devices.resinstaging.io 0d30096f589da97eb9236abeaee3625a
  $ leech diagnose -u=unicorn 0d30096f589da97eb9236abeaee3625a
```

## Configuration

| Environment variable | Default     | Required |
|-----------------------|-------------|----------|
| LEECH_DIR             | $HOME/leech |          |

## Mapping issues

The cli, will parse the out put from commands in `diagnose.sh` line by line matching against regexes defined in `/lib/contants.ts`, Each issue must have an `id` which correlates to github issue number, a `regex` for matching logs and a `link` to some form of documentation on the bug.

## Analytics

Every leech on a remote device is reported to mixpanel.

`leech` event example:
```
{
  distint_id: `<device_uuid>`
  issues: [
    <id>,
    <id>
  ],
  stats: [
    'MEM: OK (79% available.)',
    'DOCKER: OK (docker is running.)',
    'SUPERVISOR: OK (supervisor is running)'
    ...
  ],
  leecher: <os.userInfo().username>,
  leech_version: '1.1.6'
}
```

If the first argument is not used it defaults to `resin`.

## Hacking

To add more checks, simply add commands to the `commands` array in
`diagnose.sh`.
