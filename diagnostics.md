# Diagnostics

## Getting Started

The balenaCloud Dashboard includes the ability to run diagnostics on
a device to determine its current condition. This should
be the first step in attempting to diagnose an issue without having to
actually access the device via SSH. Ensuring diagnostics and health checks
are examined first ensures that you have a good idea of the state a
device is in before SSHing into it, as well as ensuring that the information can
be accessed later if required (should a device be in a catastrophic state). This
helps significantly in a support post-mortem should one be required.

Currently, diagnosis feature is only available via the Dashboard. Diagnostics are split into three separate sections: 

- [Device Health Checks](#device-health-checks) 
- [Device Diagnostics](#device-diagnostics)
- [Supervisor State](#supervisor-state)


## Device Health Checks 

To run device health checks through balenaCloud dashboard, head to the `Diagnostics` tab in the sidebar and click the `Run checks` button to start the tests.

As part of the diagnostics suite, you will find a group of checks that can be collectively run on-device. Below is a description of each check and what each means or how to triage.

A `check` in this context is defined as a function that returns a result (good/bad status plus some descriptive text), whereas a
command is simply a data collection tool without any filtering or logic built in. Checks are intended to be used by
everyone, while typically command output is used by support/subject matter experts and power users.

### check_balenaOS

| Aspect         | Information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Summary**    | This check confirms that the version of balenaOS is >2.x. There is further confirmation that the OS release has not since been removed from production. As of May 1, 2019, [balenaOS 1.x has been deprecated](https://www.balena.io/blog/all-good-things-come-to-an-end-including-balenaos-1-x/). |
| **Triage**     | Upgrade your device to the latest balenaOS 2.x (contact support if running 1.x).                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Depends on** | Parts of this check depend on fully functional networking stack (see [check_networking](#check_networking)).                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### check_under_voltage

| Aspect      | Information                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Summary** | Often seen on Raspberry Pi devices, these kernel messages indicate that the power supply is insufficient for the device and any peripherals that might be attached. These errors also precede seemingly erratic behavior. |
| **Triage**  | Replace the power supply with a known-good supply (supplying at least 5V / >2.5A).                                                                                                                                        |

### check_memory

| Aspect                              | Information                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Summary**                         | This check simply confirms that a given device is running at a given memory threshold (set to 90% at the moment). Oversubscribed memory can lead to OOM events.             |
| **Triage**                          | Using a tool like `top`, scan the process table for which process(es) are consuming the most memory (`%VSZ`) and check                                                      |
| for memory leaks in those services. |
| **Further Reading**                 | Oversubscribed memory can lead to OOM events (learn more about the [out-of-memory killer](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/mm/concepts.html#oom-killer)). |

### check_container_engine

| Aspect      | Information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Summary** | This check confirms the container engine is up and healthy. Additionally, this check confirms that there have been no unclean restarts of the engine. These restarts could be caused by crashlooping. The container engine is an integral part of the balenaCloud pipeline. |
| **Triage**  | It is best to let balena's support team take a look before restarting the container engine. At the very least, take a diagnostics snapshot before restarting anything.                                                                                                      |

### check_supervisor

| Aspect      | Information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Summary** | This check confirms the Supervisor is up and healthy. The Supervisor is an integral part of the balenaCloud pipeline. The Supervisor depends on the container engine being healthy (see [check_container_engine](#check_container_engine)). There is also a check to confirm the running Supervisor is a released version, and that the Supervisor is running the intended release from the API. |
| **Triage**  | It is best to let balena's support team take a look before restarting the supervisor. At the very least, take a diagnostics snapshot before restarting anything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### check_localdisk

| Aspect      | Information                                                                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Summary** | This check combines a few metrics about the local storage media and reports back any potential issues. |


### test_disk_space

| Aspect              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Summary**         | Confirms device disk utilization is below a set threshold (90%). High disk usage can cause issues in supervisor and release containers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Triage**          | Run `du -a /mnt/data/docker                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | sort -nr | head -10` in the hostOS shell to identify large files/directories for cleanup. |
| **Further Reading** | If the results indicate large files in `/mnt/data/docker/containers`, this result often indicates a leakage in a container that can be cleaned up (runaway logs, too much local data, etc). Further info can be found in the [Device Debugging Masterclass](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/more/masterclasses/device-debugging/#111-out-of-space-issues). |

### test_write_latency

| Aspect              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| **Summary**         | Compares partition's average write latency to a target (1s), accounting for write number and size variability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Triage**          | Slow disk writes could indicate hardware issues or heavy disk I/O, warranting further investigation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Further Reading** | There are some caveats to this test that are worth considering. Since it attempts to categorize a distribution with a point sample, the reported sample size should always be considered. Smaller sample sizes are prone to fluctuations that do not necessarily indicate failure. Additionally, the metric sampled is merely the number of writes disregarding the size of each write, which again may be noisy with few samples. Writes come primarily from application workloads and less often from operating system operations. For more information, see the [relevant kernel documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/iostats.txt). |

| **Triage**  | Confirm that NTP is not blocked at the network level, and that any specified upstream NTP servers are accessible. If absolutely necessary, it is possible to temporarily sync the clock using HTTP headers (though this change will not persist across reboots). Further info can be found in the [Device Debugging Masterclass](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/more/masterclasses/device-debugging/#61-ntp-failure). |
| **Depends on** | Depends on a fully functional networking stack (see [check_networking](#check_networking)). |

| **Summary**    | Any checks with names beginning with `check_service_` come from user-defined services. These checks query the engine to see if any services are restarting uncleanly/unexpectedly.                                                                                                                      |
| **Triage**     | Investigate the logs of whichever service(s) are restarting uncleanly or failing health checks. This issue could be a bug in the error handling or start-up of the aforementioned unhealthy services. These checks are wholly limited in scope to user services and should be triaged by the developer. |
| **Depends on** | This check depends on the container engine being healthy (see [check_container_engine](#check_container_engine)).                                                                                                                                                                                       |


## Building & Surfacing your own healthchecks in the dashboard

We allow users to provide their own health checks using the [HEALTHCHECK directive](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck) defined in the Dockerfile or docker-compose file. With healthchecks, you can test a container to check that it's still working and healthy.

Any health check output will be collected as-is, truncated to 100 characters, and shown as output along with the exit code. The result of the health check will be available in the dashboard in the `Diagnostics` page under the `Device health checks` tab.

Here's a [working example](https://github.com/balena-io-examples/healthcheck-publicurl) of how **HEALTHCHECK directive** works in a balenaCloud dashboard demo. 


## Device Diagnostics

Move to the `Device Diagnostics` tab on the `Diagnostics` page and click the
`Run diagnostics` button.

Device diagnostics can be considered a more detailed snapshot of a running
system as opposed to the healthchecks, which give the current status of a few
of the core components of the OS.

Once the diagnostic run has completed, you'll see a lot of logs from commands
that have been run. The section `--- COMMANDS ---` shows a list of all of the
commands that are run to produce the diagnostics report. These commands cover
a wide range of functionality, but are comprised of 5 main areas:

- **BALENA** - The balenaEngine and latest journals
- **HARDWARE** - All aspects of HW, including CPU, memory and device tree info
  as well as statistics on device nodes, USB devices and disk space
- **NETWORK** - Covering everything from the current interface configurations
  to test pings/curls of remote hosts, the state of DNSmasq, OpenVPN and
  the current iptables configuration
- **OS** - This includes the current device configuration, the kernel log,
  the boot journal and the state of any HUP that may have been attempted
- **SUPERVISOR** - The current state and logs for the Supervisor
- **TIME** - The current date, state of the time and uptime for the device

Examination of this output will help to determine if something is not working
correctly. 

## Supervisor State

Click the `Supervisor State` tab on the `Diagnostics` page.

This does not require execution, and immediately queries the Supervisor to
determine its current configuration. This output is shown in two panels:

- **Supervisor status** - This is the current status of the Supervisor, including the address and port it can be reached on, the versions pertaining to it and the current status (note that this only works should the VPN be operational and connected to the balenaCloud backend).
  
- **Target supervisor state** - This is the target state for the Supervisor, based upon the release the device is associated with (usually this is the latest release, unless otherwise pinned). This includes all of the services, and any configuration set for each service, for the fleet, as well as configuration (such as boot and device tree settings).

The Supervisor status should always be available; if it isn't, this
is an initial indication that something is wrong (including the Supervisor
itself failing to run).

The Supervisor status is useful for ensuring that versions of the Supervisor/OS
and access to the API is as expected (or has been changed, should access
be required).

The Target supervisor state is extremely useful for ensuring that a release is running
correctly upon a device (as the `docker-compose` manifest for the release
can be read from the fleet's 'Release' page in the Dashboard), as well
as ensuring it's the commit that's expected.
